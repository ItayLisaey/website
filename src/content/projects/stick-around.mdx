Have you ever found yourself sitting through the credits of a movie, wondering if there's going to be an extra scene or Easter egg at the end? "Stick Around" is an app that can help answer that question.

Built using React and Ionic Capacitor, "Stick Around" provides a simple and reliable way to find out whether or not a movie has an end credits scene. Just search for the film you're interested in, and the app will let you know if there's anything special waiting for you after the credits roll.

But "Stick Around" doesn't just provide information ‚Äì it also allows users to get involved by voting on whether they think a movie has an end credits scene. This helps us keep the database up-to-date and accurate, ensuring that you can always rely on "Stick Around" for the most accurate information.

In addition to solving a personal problem for me, building "Stick Around" also allowed me to gain valuable skills and knowledge. The app server was written in Go and deployed on Google Cloud Platform using Cloud Run, two previously unknown technologies to me, helping me improve both my language repertoire and my hands-on cloud experience. Additionally, I learned how to distribute apps on Google Play, adding to my expertise in app development.

So whether you're a movie buff looking to enhance your viewing experience or simply curious about end credits scenes, "Stick Around" is a useful and user-friendly tool that can help you get the answers you're looking for.

I consider this project very successful, being my first solo development project with currently with about 500 MAU, 10K+ downloads and an average of 4.5 stars review and little to no marketing (wrote some posts in reddit).
