"Prodentifier" is not just a utility; it's a lesson in simplicity and a testament to how effortlessly you can publish straightforward packages to npm. This tool was created with the sole purpose of showing my team members the straightforward process of sharing simple utilities with the developer community.

**Project Origins:**
Prodentifier was born out of a desire to demystify the npm package publishing process. It's essentially a tool that prints configured environment variables in your CI/CD pipeline. However, its primary role is to serve as a example for my team members, showcasing the ease with which even the simplest utilities can be shared and published through npm.

**Key Aspects:**

1. **Simplicity at Its Core:** Prodentifier's core functionality is as simple as it gets - displaying environment variables. It doesn't aim to be fancy or complex. Instead, it focuses on demonstrating how to create, package, and share such straightforward tools.

2. **Educational Resource:** While its utility is apparent, Prodentifier's main value lies in being an educational resource. It helped me guide my team members through the steps of creating an npm package, from code development to publishing, emphasizing the accessibility of open-source contribution.
