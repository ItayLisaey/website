This project is a Next.js web application designed to allow users to craft their forms, akin to tools such as "Google Forms" and "Typeform." Beyond form creation, it offers the ability to publish and share these forms as interactive surveys.

The website encompasses three key components:

1. **Hub**: The central hub serves as a dashboard where users can effortlessly access all the forms they've created and published.

1. **Builder**: The form-building module equips users with the tools to construct intricate forms with ease, emphasizing the dynamic capabilities of libraries like Formik.

1. **Viewer**: The viewer interface allows respondents to view and submit forms, ensuring a seamless and engaging user experience.

### Project Objectives

In conceiving and developing this project, I had two principal objectives in mind:

1. **Dynamic Form Handling with Formik**: One of my primary goals was to illustrate how to levrage libraries like Formik in simplifying form creation and validation. This project showcases how Formik can streamline the process, making it accessible to developers of varying backgrounds.

1. **Next.js Capabilities, Particularly API Routes**: The project also serves as a demo to the capabilities of Next.js, with a particular focus on leveraging its API routes. By utilizing Next.js, I aimed to demonstrate the potential for building performant and responsive web applications with server-side rendering and efficient data handling to my team members.
