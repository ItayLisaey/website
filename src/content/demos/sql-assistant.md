The AI-Powered SQL Assistant is a demo that serves as an example of the incredible capabilities offered by OpenAI's tools and APIs. This specific example is a tool allows users to seamlessly transform natural language queries into SQL queries, simplifying the database querying process.

## Project Purpose

The creation of this application stemmed from a desire to showcase OpenAI's tools and APIs to my team. It serves as an educational resource, highlighting how easy it is and how great the potential of AI-powered interfaces are.

## Key Features

The demo unfolds across three sequential screens, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience.

1. **Database Description:** Begin your journey by providing a detailed description of your database. Specify the tables, columns, and the nature of the data the database holds. This step sets the stage for accurate and context-aware querying.

2. **Query:** Next up is the Query screen. Here, the user has the freedom to pose questions in plain, natural language. The user's query will be transformed into SQL, allowing for effortless interaction with the database.

3. **SQL Result:** The culmination of the user's exploration leads to the SQL Result screen. Here, the user can view the SQL query generated based on their natural language input. It's a place for refining the query and fine-tuning interactions with the database. The user can keep iterating until he achieves the desired results.
