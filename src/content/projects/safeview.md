SafeView is a component that allows you to hide sensitive information in your app visually, for presentation purposes, and more.

The system was created to tackle a specific challenge related to presentations made to the senior leadership. In these presentations, which often involved systems with sensitive information, a common issue arose. To address this, I developed a passive keyboard shortcut that discreetly blurred sensitive information on the screen, ensuring data confidentiality during these presentations.
It's really only a quick, visual trick but it made my experience and those presentations safer and easier.
